            <summary>	
            The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.SoundBufferDescription"/> structure describes the characteristics of a new buffer object. It is used by theIDirectSound8::CreateSoundBuffermethod and by theDirectSoundFullDuplexCreate8function.<p>An earlier version of this structure, DSBUFFERDESC1, is maintained in Dsound.h for compatibility with DirectX 7 and earlier.</p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>When creating a primary buffer, applications must set the dwBufferBytes member to zero. DirectSound will determine the best buffer size for the particular sound device in use. To determine the size of a created primary buffer, call IDirectSoundBuffer8::GetCaps.</p> <p>The DSBCAPS_CTRLDEFAULT flag is no longer supported. This flag was defined as <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlPan"/> | <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlVolume"/> | <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlFrequency"/>. By specifying only the flags you need, you cut down on unnecessary resource usage.</p> <p>On VXD drivers, a sound buffer created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.ControlPositionNotify"/> is always a software buffer, because the VXD driver model does not support notifications. With WDM drivers, a notification-enabled buffer can be in hardware, if hardware resources are available.</p> <p>The <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Hardware"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Software"/> flags are optional and mutually exclusive. <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Hardware"/> forces the buffer to reside in hardware, meaning that it will be mixed by the sound card. <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferFlags.Software"/> forces the buffer to reside in software, where it is mixed by the CPU. These flags are also defined for the dwFlags member <see cref="T:SharpDX.DirectSound.BufferCapabilities"/>.</p> <p>The 3D algorithms represent selection of the software emulation layer only: that is, the software algorithm that is used when no hardware is present for acceleration. In order to maximize hardware utilization, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> is treated as a special case. If no free 3D hardware voices are available, the buffer is then treated as a 2D buffer, but with 3D control. Specifically, when a sound buffer is created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/>, or when the buffer is played if the buffer was created with DSBPLAY_LOCDEFER, the following procedure is followed:</p> <ol> <li><p>If a free hardware 3D voice is available, that 3D hardware voice is used.</p></li> <li><p>If no free hardware 3D voices are available and a 2D hardware voice is available, that 2D hardware voice will be used. This is possible because the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> algorithm is a simple stereo pan algorithm</p></li> <li><p>If no free 2D or 3D hardware voices are available, the voice will be played in software using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> algorithm.</p></li> </ol> <p>If a speaker configuration other than <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.SpeakerConfiguration.Headphone"/> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.SpeakerConfiguration.Stereo"/> is in effect, the processing will be done as if for a two-speaker configuration.</p> <p>If a buffer is created using one of the HRTF algorithms, and the HRTF algorithm is not available on the system (for example, a non-WDM system), a success code, DS_NO_VIRTUALIZATION, is returned. The sound buffer created will use <see cref="F:SharpDX.DirectSound.DirectSound3DAlgorithmGuid.NoVirtualization3DAlgorithm"/> instead. For this reason, applications should use the SUCCEEDED or FAILED macros rather than checking explicitly for DS_OK when calling CreateSoundBuffer.</p>
